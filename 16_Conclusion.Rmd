# Conclusion

A feature of R, and open source software in general, is that there are multiple ways to achieve the same result.

## Package Choice

The authors recommend using the more recent, more performant and future-proof `sf` package.

As of mid-2023, there are more than 160 packages mentioned in the Spatial Task View and countless functions for geographic data analysis are developed each year.

The author's advice is to start by learning one approach in depth but to have a general understanding of the breadth of available options.

## Gaps and Overlaps

Some topics are covered in-depth elsewhere.

See [https://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/dgr2/teach/](https://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/dgr2/teach/)

and [https://sdesabbata.github.io/r-for-geographic-data-science/](https://sdesabbata.github.io/r-for-geographic-data-science/)

Big data has largely been omitted from this book.  But follow Apache Sedona and GeoParquet (or even geo-Arrow) for the latest developments

## Getting Help

- start from first principles, make a sketch
- diagnose individual lines for expected output
- read the docs
- consider a broader on-line search. GPT-3 or stack overflow are built on prior answers
- if all else fails, build a reprex and ask in a forum like R4DS

Forums mentioned:

- R‚Äôs Special Interest Group on Geographic data email list (R-SIG-GEO)
- The GIS Stackexchange website at gis.stackexchange.com
- stackoverflow.com
- the RStudio Community, rOpenSci and the Stan forum
- GitHub, which often has discussion and issue features.  See `sfnetworks` package as an example
- Slack for rOpenSci and geocompx community, of which this book is a part

Demonstrating your own efforts to solve a problem publicly, and providing a reproducible example of the problem, is a way of contributing to this body of knowledge.

## Where to go next

See Geocomputation with Python, for an introduction to geocomputation with Python.

The authors recommend exploring and learning new research topics and methods from academic and theoretical perspectives. Many methods that have been written about have yet to be implemented. Learning about geographic methods and potential applications can therefore be rewarding, before writing any code.

## FOSS

One of the elements of the term introduced in Chapter 1 was that geographic methods should have a positive impact. Of course, how to define and measure ‚Äòpositive‚Äô is a subjective, philosophical question, beyond the scope of this book. Regardless of your worldview, consideration of the impacts of geocomputational work is a useful exercise: the potential for positive impacts can provide a powerful motivation for future learning and, conversely, new methods can open-up many possible fields of application. These considerations lead to the conclusion that geocomputation is part of a wider ‚Äòopen source approach‚Äô.

Reproducibility

- encourages creativity by shifting the focus away from the basics (which are readily available through shared code) and towards applications;
- discourages people from ‚Äòreinventing the wheel‚Äô: there is no need to re-do what others have done if their methods can be used by others; and
- makes research more conducive to real world applications, by enabling anyone in any sector to apply your methods in new areas.

The open source approach is more than a technical entity. It is a community composed of people interacting daily with shared aims: to produce high performance tools, free from commercial or legal restrictions, that are accessible for anyone to use. The open source approach to working with geographic data has advantages that transcend the technicalities of how the software works, encouraging learning, collaboration and an efficient division of labor.

It is instructive to watch the incessant development activity happen in public fora such as GitHub, but it is even more rewarding to become an active participant. This is one of the greatest features of the open source approach: it encourages people to get involved.

Cohort1 reviewed Transportation, Geomarketing, and Conclusion together 

00:08:11	Olivier Leroy:	start
00:17:50	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	The Spatial R book also goes over this Bristol case study, but also normalizes the calculations (by area or by population)
00:18:50	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "The Spatial R book a..." with üëç
00:20:50	Olivier Leroy:	I just realize it was origine destination 2 lines
00:20:58	Olivier Leroy:	realized*
00:21:46	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	yeah, these geospatial authors really like short variable names
00:24:27	Olivier Leroy:	It would become very heavy on computation
00:30:49	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	so, does making desire lines reduce path-finding computation?
00:35:18	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "so, does making desi..."

My guess is yes because you just calculate one way and not lets say the five shortest one
00:44:00	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	I like these case studies (reminds me of city planning courses)
00:44:12	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "I like these case st..." with üëç
00:45:22	Olivier Leroy:	Older üòõ
00:46:32	Olivier Leroy:	Why do all gov agency are using this old tricks of negative value for na
00:47:15	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	To be fair, many of us R programmers barely really know what NA, NULL, etc. are
00:47:35	Olivier Leroy:	And all the NA_ üòõ
00:50:37	Olivier Leroy:	Dusseldorf is large!
00:51:59	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	The German regions are nuts!

00:52:05	Olivier Leroy:	OSM is so good in Germany, so many mappers
00:52:31	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	Reacted to "OSM is so good in Ge..." with üòª
00:55:18	Olivier Leroy:	Raster here save a lot of calculation
00:57:38	Olivier Leroy:	H3 indexes also
00:59:54	Tony Vota:	I have used the gistackexchange site with success
01:00:00	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "I have used the gist..." with üëç
