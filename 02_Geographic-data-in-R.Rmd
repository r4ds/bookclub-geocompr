# Geographic data in R

**Learning objectives:**

- Learning the fundamental data models: **vector** and **raster**
- Exploring **sf** and **terra** for each one 

## Introduction

A model is way to represent reality:  

- Vector data model: it uses points, lines and polygons.

- Raster data model: it divides the surface into cells (pixel) of *constant size* (aerial photography, remote sensing)

Using one of them depend of use cases, domain of applications. It is not uncommon to use both at the same time. 


```{r loading_02}
library("sf")
library("terra")
library("spData")
# install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://nowosad.r-universe.dev")
library("spDataLarge")
```

## Vector data:

**Warning**: In R a `vector` a `class`with type.

> Geographic vector data model is base in points located with a CRS.

Examples: center of London, a bus stop, a tree in a park, a pylon, etc ..   

Then we can link this points to represent more complex object (roads, administrative boundary)

```{r vectorplots, fig.cap="Source: Gecompx.  Illustration of vector (point) data in which location of London (the red X) is represented with reference to an origin (the blue circle). The left plot represents a geographic CRS with an origin at 0Â° longitude and latitude. The right plot represents a projected CRS with an origin located in the sea west of the South West Peninsula.", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold', echo=FALSE, fig.scap="Illustration of vector (point) data."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geocompx/geocompr/main/figures/vector_lonlat.png", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geocompx/geocompr/main/figures/vector_projected.png"))
```

**sf** provides classes for this data types and interfaces to important low level
libraries: 

- [GDAL](https://gdal.org/): reading, writing and manipulation data formats

- [PROJ](https://proj.org/): coordinate system transformations

- [GEOS](): planar geometry engine (buffer, centroid, etc) 

- [S2](): a spherical geometry engine

## Simple features (sf)

It is an open standard from Open Geospatial Consortium.

The standard has 18 geometry types and **sf** implement the 7 most import ones (points, lines, polygons, their multi-counterparts and geometry collection). 

```{r vignette, eval=FALSE}
# TODO live
vignette(package = "sf")
vignette("sf1")
```

Simple features are stored in data frame with a special column (`geom` / `geometry`). 

To explore it we will use the `world` data from `spData`(`?world`).

**sf** provides a method for the generic function `plot`:

```{r plot_01}
plot(world)
```

It can be manipulated like any other  `data.frame`.

```{r example_df_ch02}
summary(world["lifeExp"])
```

This object are easy to subset (`[row, column]`).

## Why simple features, why not using {sp}

Simple features is supported by other GIS applications (QGIS, PostGIS). 

{sf} vs {sp}:

- Fast reading and writing. 

- Enchanced plotting performance 

- **sf** can be treated as data frames for most operations 

- *sf* function are consistent and intuitive 

- works with `|>` and well with tidyverse collection of package

```{r sp_sf_conversion}
library(sp)
world_sp = as(world, "Spatial") # from an sf object to sp
# sp functions ...
world_sf = st_as_sf(world_sp)           # from sp to sf
```

## Basic map mapping

```{r}
world_asia = world[world$continent == "Asia", ]
asia = st_union(world_asia)
plot(world["pop"], reset = FALSE)
plot(asia, add = TRUE, col = "red")
```
`plot` concept is adding layer. It is good for quick vizualisation. 

-> for more advanced mapping: [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) 

But base plot is still a powerful tool:

```{r advanced_plot}
plot(world["continent"], reset = FALSE)
cex = sqrt(world$pop) / 10000
world_cents = st_centroid(world, of_largest = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(world_cents), add = TRUE, cex = cex)
```

- `expandBB` is quite good for simple context map: 

```{r}
india = world[world$name_long == "India", ] # TODO discuss the subset
plot(st_geometry(india), expandBB = c(0, 0.2, 0.1, 1), col = "gray", lwd = 3)
plot(st_geometry(world_asia), add = TRUE)
```

## Geometry types

Do you remember then?

They can be in well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT) standard. (the first one is a bit hard to read!). `st_as_binary` provide a way to convert to binary and it provides intersesting examples regarding precision. 

The standard look like that (more [here](postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html)): 

```
POINT (5 2)
LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2)
POLYGON ((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5)) # w/o hole
POLYGON ((0 0 0,4 0 0,4 4 0,0 4 0,0 0 0),(1 1 0,2 1 0,2 2 0,1 2 0,1 1 0)) # with hole / interior boundaries
MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2)
MULTILINESTRING ((1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2), (1 2, 2 4))
MULTIPOLYGON (((1 5, 2 2, 4 1, 4 4, 1 5), (0 2, 1 2, 1 3, 0 3, 0 2)))
GEOMETRYCOLLECTION (MULTIPOINT (5 2, 1 3, 3 4, 3 2), LINESTRING (1 5, 4 4, 4 1, 2 2, 3 2))
```

### In sf: the workflow:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geocompx/geocompr/main/figures/02-sfdiagram.png")
```

```{r}
lnd_point = st_point(c(0.1, 51.5))                 # sfg object
lnd_geom = st_sfc(lnd_point, crs = "EPSG:4326")    # sfc object
lnd_attrib = data.frame(                           # data.frame object
  name = "London",
  temperature = 25,
  date = as.Date("2017-06-21")
  )
lnd_sf = st_sf(lnd_attrib, geometry = lnd_geom)    # sf object
lnd_sf
```

### First is building geometry (**sfg**) 

```{r sfg}
st_point(c(5, 2, 3))              # XYZ point
st_point(c(5, 2, 3, 1))           # XYZM point
# stop at the M diemsion
linestring_matrix = rbind(c(1, 5), c(4, 4), c(4, 1), c(2, 2), c(3, 2))
st_linestring(linestring_matrix)
polygon_list = list(rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5)))
st_polygon(polygon_list)
## POLYGON with a hole
polygon_border = rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))
polygon_hole = rbind(c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4))
polygon_with_hole_list = list(polygon_border, polygon_hole)
st_polygon(polygon_with_hole_list)
```

It can be a bit tedious but this is usefull when you want to build some small/shareable example. 

### Simple feature columns (sfc)

We move from one feature to more: 

```{r}
# sfc POINT
point1 = st_point(c(5, 2))
point2 = st_point(c(1, 3))
points_sfc = st_sfc(point1, point2)
points_sfc
st_crs()
```

> All geometries in sfc objects must have the same CRS

it can be provided when building sfc

```{r}
# Set the CRS with an identifier referring to an 'EPSG' CRS code:
points_sfc_wgs = st_sfc(point1, point2, crs = "EPSG:4326")
st_crs(points_sfc_wgs) 
# TODO erase EPSG and see what we have 
```

### sfheaders package

- fully compatible with sf

- every function come with a c++ implementation (header -> hence the name) and can be linked in your package 

- it is also a bit less "verbose" 

```{r}
# matrices
m = matrix(1:8, ncol = 2)
sfheaders::sfg_linestring(obj = m)
#> LINESTRING (1 5, 2 6, 3 7, 4 8)
# data.frames
df = data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 4:1)
sfheaders::sfg_polygon(obj = df)
#> POLYGON ((1 4, 2 3, 3 2, 4 1, 1 4))
```

- sfheaders is also very good at "casting": ie converting between types (cf later!)

### Spherical geometry with s2

It is an implementation of a Discrete Global Grid System (other example is H3)


```{r}
sf_use_s2()

india_buffer_with_s2 = st_buffer(india, 1)
sf_use_s2(FALSE)
#> Spherical geometry (s2) switched off
india_buffer_without_s2 = st_buffer(india, 1)
#> Warning in st_buffer.sfc(st_geometry(x), dist, nQuadSegs, endCapStyle =
#> endCapStyle, : st_buffer does not correctly buffer longitude/latitude data
#> dist is assumed to be in decimal degrees (arc_degrees).
```
## Raster

The book will focus on regular grids, ie cell with constant size. Other grids exist.

The raster data model consists:

- an header with CRS, extent (cols, rows, cell size), origin (usually lower left)

- a matrix

Raster does not need to store CRS at every cell or at the four corner -> faster processing but a cell can only contains a single value. 

### R packages for raster data

- {raster} -> {terra}: 
  * focus on regular grid,  
  * one or multi-layered rasters,  
  * uses C++ or C++ pointers,  
  * uses its own vector data model,  
  * rely on built-in function that works on its objects

- {stars}: 
  * manage also other grids, 
  * raster data cubes,  
  * stars store value has list of array or file path to large one,  
  * rely on sf for vector,  
  * built-in function + methods for existing R functions

In both cases: 

- raster should have the same extent 

- raster can be read in memory / just the metadata

You can convert from one to an other (`st_as_stars()` or `rast()`). 

### Introduction to terra

Like **sp** you can still find a lot of **raster**. **terra** offer backward compatibility.

**terra** has the option to divide big raster in smaller chunks. 

```{r}
raster_filepath = system.file("raster/srtm.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
my_rast = rast(raster_filepath)
class(my_rast)
my_rast
ext(my_rast)
inMemory(my_rast)
# help("terra-package")
```

### Basic map making

```{r}
plot(my_rast)
# see also terra::plotRGB()
# rasterVis::levelplot()
```

### Raster classes

**terra** also uses GDAL for reading/writing. 

`rast()` can create raster from scratch:

```{r}
new_raster = rast(nrows = 6, ncols = 6, 
                  xmin = -1.5, xmax = 1.5, ymin = -1.5, ymax = 1.5,
                  vals = 1:36)
```

`SpatRaster` can also deals with multiple layers:

```{r}
multi_raster_file = system.file("raster/landsat.tif", package = "spDataLarge")
multi_rast = rast(multi_raster_file)
multi_rast
nlyr(multi_rast)
```

they can be subset: 

```{r}
multi_rast3 = subset(multi_rast, 3)
multi_rast4 = subset(multi_rast, "landsat_4")
```

And combine:

```{r}
multi_rast34 = c(multi_rast3, multi_rast4)
```

As raster are usualy not stored `.rds/.rda` are not an option to store them. We can: 

- `wrap()` / `unwrap()` to save the reference object

- `writeRaster()`

## Geographic and projected coordinate reference systems (CRS)

### Geographic coordinate systems

> Longitude is location in the East-West direction in angular distance from the Prime Meridian plane. Latitude is angular distance North or South of the equatorial plane. 

Earth is not flat! and not exactly a sphere (neither an ellipsoids)

To define an ellipsoids we need the polar (*semi-minor axis*) and equatorial radius (*semi-major axis*).

The *datum* (geocentruc / local) contains information on what kind of ellispoid use and the relation with Cartesian coordinates on earth surface. 

### Projected coordinate reference systems

- based on a geographic CRS

- Cartesian coordinates, flat surfaces with x(easting)/y(northing) origin 

- they can be conic, cylindrical, planar

### Units

CRS have specific units, **sf** use **units** to keep track of them. 

```{r}
luxembourg = world[world$name_long == "Luxembourg", ]
st_area(luxembourg) / 1000000
units::set_units(st_area(luxembourg), km^2)
#> 2409 [km^2]
```

For a raster you can use `res()`
