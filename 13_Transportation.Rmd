# Transportation

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:21:46	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	yeah, these geospatial authors really like short variable names
00:24:27	Olivier Leroy:	It would become very heavy on computation
00:30:49	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	so, does making desire lines reduce path-finding computation?
00:35:18	Olivier Leroy:	Replying to "so, does making desi..."

My guess is yes because you just calculate one way and not lets say the five shortest one
00:44:00	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	I like these case studies (reminds me of city planning courses)
00:44:12	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "I like these case st..." with üëç
00:45:22	Olivier Leroy:	Older üòõ
00:46:32	Olivier Leroy:	Why do all gov agency are using this old tricks of negative value for na
00:47:15	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	To be fair, many of us R programmers barely really know what NA, NULL, etc. are
00:47:35	Olivier Leroy:	And all the NA_ üòõ

00:52:05	Olivier Leroy:	OSM is so good in Germany, so many mappers
00:52:31	Derek Sollberger (he/his):	Reacted to "OSM is so good in Ge..." with üòª
00:55:18	Olivier Leroy:	Raster here save a lot of calculation
00:57:38	Olivier Leroy:	H3 indexes also
00:59:54	Tony Vota:	I have used the gistackexchange site with success
01:00:00	Olivier Leroy:	Reacted to "I have used the gist..." with üëç
