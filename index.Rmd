# Welcome {-}

Welcome to the bookclub! 

This is a companion for the book [_Geocomputation with R_](https://r.geocompx.org/) by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, Jannes Muenchow (we're reading 2e, but 1e is [available from CRC Press](https://www.routledge.com/9781138304512)).
This companion is available at [dslc.io/geocompr](https://dslc.io/geocompr).

This website is being developed by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io). Follow along, and [join the community](https://dslc.io/join) to participate.

This companion follows the [Data Science Learning Community Code of Conduct](https://dslc.io/conduct).

## Book club meetings {-}

- Each week, a volunteer will present a chapter from the book (or part of a chapter).
  - **This is the best way to learn the material.**
- Presentations will usually consist of a review of the material, a discussion, and/or a demonstration of the principles presented in that chapter. (feel free to be creative as long the review of the material is done in some ways!)
- More information about how to present is available in the [github repo](https://github.com/r4ds/bookclub-geocompr).
- Presentations will be recorded, and will be available on the [Data Science Learning Community YouTube Channel](https://dslc.io/youtube).

## Pace {-}

- We'll _try_ to cover 1 chapter/week, but...
- ...It's ok to split chapters when they feel like too much.
- We will try to meet every week, but will likely take some breaks for holidays, etc.  
- We will have a break in two weeks for "daylights saving madness"  
- Learning online is difficult, sometimes we do not understand everything, be kind to other and yourself but try to follow the "flow"    

## Quick round of introduction: 

- Yourself  
- Where are you from/joining the club?  
- What are your goals reading this book 
- How many holes does a straw have?
